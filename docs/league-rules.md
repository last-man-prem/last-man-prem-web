## FAQs
### How will I know if I have already picked a team twice?
There will be a document of all selections including how many times each player has selected a team. If you have selected a team twice already, you will be advised accordingly to re-pick.

### What happens during a blank/double gameweek?
During blank/double gameweeks, players will have the opportunity to vote to play or bypass the round. The decision will be based on the majority in favour or against. This will be instructed via the league announcements channel when required.

### What happens in the event of a points draw?
Following the conclusion of the season if two or more players finish on the same amount of points, then the winner will be decided by the amount of 3 point weeks accrued. I.e if Player 1 has 4x 3PT wins and Player 2 has 3x, Player 1 will be crowned champion. Should both players have the same amount of 3PT wins, it will then be decided on clean sheets.

## Example Score System
Selection: Manchester City
